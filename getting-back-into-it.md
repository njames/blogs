#Getting Back Into Fit

During the last half of last year I developed a bit of a back twinge. I saw a physio 
and while it improved a little it, it wasn't great and I just before Christmas it 
went from annoying to acute and debilitating.

I went to a Chiropracter who immmediately ordered an MRI and when the results 
came in he said, 'I can see you are not faking'.

It turns out that I had a 'herniated disc' which was pressing on the sciatic nerve.

That is a pain that I wouldn't wish on anybody.

My Chiro was able to help for a little while and it did improve but then ...

... I sneezed. 

I sneezed at just the wrong angle and it undid all the weeks of work that the chiro 
had been doing. I got him to talk to a neurosurgeon and then next day I was in his office. 
Seven days after that I was going under the knife.

My choise was either to manage the pain or to sort it.

Given that my work tends to take me away from home regularly I certainly couldn't 
afford to be having a relapse far from home.
