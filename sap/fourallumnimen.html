<p>Culture is extremly important in any organisation.</p>
<p>It has been said that &quot;culture eats strategy for breakfast&quot;(1). I might go so far as to say culture eats everything for breakfast. Culture is the way we do things around here. It is a collective habits and norms of any organisation.</p>
<p>So if you take the plotted the habits of an organisation the culture that emerges is the where the plot has the most focus.</p>
<p>So if a there is a culture of celebration in an organisation when one member of the organisation achieves something it is celebrated and evveryone is overjoyed at the great work and effort that they have been doing. If there is a culture of backstabbing then tight cliques will form and talk about those in those cliques.</p>
<p>So two important points about culture:</p>
<ol>
<li>The collective culture is made up of collection of individual habits</li>
<li>Individuals can change</li>
</ol>
<p>So if we want to change our collective culture individuals have to change.</p>
<p>One way to affect this is by having the older members of a community be involved with the younger members. Grandparents telling grandchildren stories about what it was like for them when they grew up. Not to glory in the &#39;good-old-days&#39; but to share stories of triumph over insurmountable odds, to pass on courage and to beieve in a better tommorrow.</p>
<p>With all this in mind a couple of the Senior mentors and Alumni got together and decided one way to impart a little culture was to do a little sketch in the style of Monty Python.</p>
<p>This was performed at the SAP TechEd &amp;&amp; d-Code mentors meeting by John Astill, Mark Finnnern, Graham Robertson and myself.</p>
<pre><code>The Four Alumni­men(tors) 


THE SCENE: 
Four well­dressed men are sitting together at a vacation resort sipping on glasses of wine and eating a delicious meal.

FIRST ALUMNI­MAN: 
Aye, very passable, that, very passable bit of risotto. 

SECOND ALUMNI­MAN: 
Nothing like a good glass of Château de Chasselas, eh? 

THIRD ALUMNI­MAN: 
You&#39;re right there, Mark. 

FOURTH ALUMNI­MAN: 
Who&#39;d have thought 7 years ago we&#39;d all be sittin&#39; here drinking Château de Chasselas, eh and 
meeting with all these executives?  

FIRST ALUMNI­MAN: 
In them days we used to be glad to have the price of t­shirt on our back 

SECOND ALUMNI­MAN: 
badly fitting t­shirt 

FOURTH ALUMNI­MAN: 
without sleeves or collar 

THIRD ALUMNI­MAN: 
or shirt! 

SECOND ALUMNI­MAN: 
Best we could do is wrap our selves up in some torn up rags 

THIRD ALUMNIMAN: 
But you know, we were happy in those days, though we were poor. 

FIRST ALUMNIMAN: 
Because we were poor. My old Dad used to say to me, &quot;Money doesn&#39;t buy you happiness, son&quot;. 

FOURTH ALUMNIMAN: 
Aye, &#39;e was right. 

FIRST ALUMNIMAN: 
Aye, &#39;e was. 

FOURTH ALUMNIMAN: 
I was happier then and I had nothin&#39;. We would be happy to meet with executives for lunch. 

THIRD ALUMNI­MAN: 
Executive meetings eh?: We had to hold Hasso hostage with a &quot;I stop at every user exit&quot; sticker, 
just  to get a picture with him.  

FIRST ALUMNI­MAN: 
Picture? with an executive? We had bribe executive with Hugh MacLeod prints to mere seconds 
of their attention 

FOURTH ALUMNI­MAN: 
Well when I say Lunch it was more executive tossing us a piece of stale bread into coding lab on 
way to keynote but it were lunch to us. 

SECOND ALUMNI­MAN: 
We used to dream of coding lab ... 

FIRST ALUMNI­MAN: 
Coding Lab! You were lucky to code in lab ! We used to code in one room, all twenty­six of us, 
no desks, &#39;alf the floor was missing, and we were all &#39;uddled together in one corner for fear of 
falling. 

THIRD ALUMNI­MAN: 
Eh, you were lucky to have a room! We used to have to code in t&#39; corridor! 

FIRST ALUMNI­MAN: 
Oh, we used to dream of coding in a corridor! Would ha&#39; been a palace to us. We used to code 
in an old water tank on a rubbish tip. We got woke up every morning by having a load of rotting 
fish dumped all over us! Coding lab? Huh. 

FOURTH ALUMNI­MAN: 
Well, when I say coding lab it was only a hole in the ground covered by a sheet of tarpaulin, but it 
was a lab to us. 

SECOND ALUMNI­MAN: 
We were evicted from our &#39;ole in the ground; we &#39;ad to go and code in a lake. 

THIRD ALUMNI­MAN: 
You were lucky to have a lake! There were a hundred and fifty of us coding  in t&#39; shoebox in t&#39; 
middle o&#39; road. 

FIRST ALUMNI­MAN: 
Cardboard box? 

THIRD ALUMNI­MAN: 
Aye. 

FIRST ALUMNI­MAN: 
You were lucky. We were on project for three months while living  in a paper bag in a septic tank. 
We used to have to get up at six in the morning, clean the paper bag, eat a crust of stale bread, 
go and write code in ide, fourteen hours a day, week­in week­out, for sixpence a week, and when 
we got home our Dad would thrash us to sleep wi&#39; his belt. 

SECOND ALUMNI­MAN: 
Luxury. We used to have to get out of the lake at six o&#39;clock in the morning, clean the lake, eat a 
handful of &#39;ot gravel, code twenty hour day in notepad for tuppence a month, come home, and 
Dad would thrash us to sleep with a broken bottle, if we were lucky! 

THIRD ALUMNI­MAN: 
Well, of course, we had it tough. We used to &#39;ave to get up out of shoebox at twelve o&#39;clock at 
night and lick road clean wit&#39; tongue. We had two bits of cold gravel for breakfast, code twenty­four hours a day in assembly language for sixpence every four years, and when we got 
home our Dad would slice us in two wit&#39; bread knife. 

FOURTH ALUMNI­MAN: 
Right. I had to get up in the morning at ten o&#39;clock at night half an hour before I went to bed, drink 
a cup of sulphuric acid, code in binary twenty­nine hours a day, and pay project manager  for 
permission to come to work, and when we got home, our Dad and Mum would kill us and 
dance about on our graves singing Hallelujah. 

FIRST ALUMNI­MAN: 
And you try and tell the young mentors of today that ..... they won&#39;t believe you. 

ALL:
They won&#39;t! No no they wont .

<p>For all those new mentors I hope you enjoy your mentorship and I look forward to seeing the fruits of your participation.</p>
