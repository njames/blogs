# ABAP - The Special Snowflake

The other day I poked the bear. Bears for the most part are things that should be left to their own devices as my Canadian friends will attest.

#ESME was a Enterprise Social Media Experiment that happened around 2007ish and could have been something cool. It became an apache project which was qudos to the people driving it https://esme.apache.org/.

With that backgroud Den was asking about what the new cool edgy thing was around SAP these days. As I said in my tweet above it is my opinion that that is #AbapGit with a whole lot of whitespace until second.

Then (which is what I was hoping would happen ) Den looked into #AbapGit and dropped the following:

It is seriously good stuff.

The conversation that followed continued on for days across timezones picking up a whole lot of other voices and opinions on the way through. 

My attempt with this blog is to try and bring some of those opinions into one place and simulate the conversation further as to what sort of innovation we are looking for around the SAP technology space. 

Let me provide a disclaimer for those that love ABAP to a fault ( Hi Michelle, Hi Jellana ) . Yes, ABAP is awesome and yes is does power half the planet if you believe SAP's marketing department but being great is not enough - all languages need to improve and get better. 

Am you saying that ABAP is not doing this? I mean that is a pretty provocative, click-baity title you put on this blog there Nigel.

Yes is is provocative and no - ABAP is innovating ( Hi Horst ) There are incredibly talentent people inside and outside SAP pushing to improve the language, toolset and culture to become the best that is can be and when they are finished they will go some more.

The problem is that good ol' ABAP is for all intents closed source prorietory language. My other two favourite languages that include the letter P ( Python and PHP ) are not. They have continually innovated around their core. Just the other day I saw [Zeev Suraski](https://twitter.com/zeevs) one of the co-architects of PHP
