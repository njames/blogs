<body><h1><span>&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"&gt;Flashback&lt;/span&gt;</span></h1>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: #575757;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Earlier today I was looking for a draft blog that I had started with a simple title as a memory job for me to come back and flesh out. Then I found this blog that I had written up over the course of several plane trips worth of waiting in lounges last year. Given that this year at SAP TechEd I presented a similar Introductor GIT course for ABAPers I thought I should dust this off and polish it up for your enjoyment and learning pleasure.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #575757;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>h2. </span><span style="color: #575757;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Call for Papers</span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">When there was a call for community sessions before #SAPtd I jumped on the opportunity to present on two topics that I feel were going to be under-represented at the event.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Git</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">So I proposed two abstracts to the community talk selection committee and they told me that they while they were very excited about both topics they could only take one and they would take the first one. Well I was excited, but to be honest, also a little dissapointed. As much as I wanted to talk on communication skills for developers I really wanted to introduce ABAPers to Git as a method of source code control as I know it will become very important as we move toward the HCP and OpenUI5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">As we got closer to the conference I was advised that one of other speakers that was selected had to withdraw and I was asked to prepare my second talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">This presentation was only delivered at #SAPtd in Las Vegas so all the people going to Berlin will miss out. For this reason and that there should be a bit of an intro to Git here on SCN. I thought I would distill my off the cuff talk into a short blog for the benefit of the ABAPers in the universe.</span></p>
<p><span>h1. </span><br /><span> </span></p>
<h1><span>&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"&gt;Welcome to Source Control&lt;/span&gt;</span></h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">So source control is not a new subject to ABAPers. We are used to putting our code into transport requests, which then enables the code to be delivered across the landscape and into production in an orderly manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Let's for a moment think about what happens when you put a code artifact into a transport request. It's not that hard. You lock the object so that you and only you can work on the object at one time. Until you release your transport, everyone else is prevented from doing anything to that object.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">This is all well and good, but what happens in the following scenario?</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">You are working on a new feature request.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">A bug is discovered in production that related directly to your code object.</span></li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Well resolving the bug will obviously trump the new feature but you are halfway though your change and it will need to be parked while the emergency is dealt with.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">The challenge is you change request might have a whole bunch of other objects that are not ready to go to prod, let alone ready for regression testing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">So mostly you do something like the following:</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Copy all of your changes to notepad* and save the file for safekeeping.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Hack the lock on the transport request and remove your file from your transport request</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Copy the code from the prior transport (or back from production if they are different)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Open a new transport request.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Make the hotfix.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Release the new transport.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Add your object back into the old request and merge your changes in from the file you saved.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">When you are ready you release the transport.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">While this is functional and it is not the best. Also note that only one person can be working on each file at once.</span></p>
<p><span>h1. </span><br /><span> </span></p>
<h1><span>&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"&gt;Enter Git&lt;/span&gt;</span></h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">So what's so great about Git. Well, for starters the file types involved in a OpenUI5 project don't have to be edited in SE80. In fact you can set up your system to work on your project locally on your machine and there are many great blogs here on SCN to help you with that. This means that you can work on your project on the move rather that having to be connected to the ABAP app server in the same way you need to in the ABAP world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Rather like I am doing right now :</span></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is subtle in black and white but my command line prompt has changed from being round brackets and green to red curly brackets. This is my visual cue that my tracking is not up to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So let's see what is going on:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>06:08:00 </span><span> ~/squarecloud/NextBigThing$ git status</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new',courier; color: #000000;">  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new',courier; color: #000000;">    ProjectOverview.md</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new',courier; color: #000000;">nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>06:12:09 </span><span> ~/squarecloud/NextBigThing$ git add ProjectOverview.md </span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>06:14:10 </span><span> ~/squarecloud/NextBigThing$ git commit -m "Initial brainstorming for the NextBigThing</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><br /><code><code>"</code></code></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new',courier; color: #000000;">[master (root-commit) 4ec926f] Initial brainstorming for the NextBigThing</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Did you notice that the brackets have now changed back to curly?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This work-add-commit loop is what you will do most with git.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><br /><code></code></span><br /><span>h1. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Share and share a like</span></p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We now need to share this idea with our stakeholders and team so we are going to create a repository on GitHub and then push our work there for all to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So we log onto GitHub and find the big green 'Add Repository' button. Personally, I love green for postive actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">(image)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We have to fill out the Repository name which has to be unique under your account. We enter a description and decide if we are making this public or private. I want the world to know about my new idea so of course we are making this public.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are a couple of other options:</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Initialize with a README</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Add .gitignore</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Add a licence</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As we have content for our repository already we are going to leave these blank but if you were creating a repo from scratch on the GitHub site it would be pretty handy to choose these options.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A README.md is created if you select option one. This is a handy place to tell the world about your repo as it is displayed by default on the GitHub site.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The .gitignore file tells git which files to ignore when committing your code. This is handy if your IDE creates project files or there are secure files that are not appropriate to be shared publicly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly the licence is a handy feature for open source project that needs to have a licence to be considered open source.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So, with all that out of the way, we press another Big Green Button and create our project.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Git now presents us with options as to how to clone or push our repo.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Since we have content allready we are going to push our repo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new',courier; color: #000000;">10:10:44 (master) ~/squarecloud/NextBigThing$</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now if we refresh the GitHub repo page we can see all the commits made to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The rest of the world can now clone our repo and find out about the NextBigThing.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>h1. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Clone me baby, one more time</span></p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If we look at the repository properties we can see there is a url that we can use to clone the repo. There are several protocols we can use. Firstly we can use http or (and this is my preference) we can use ssh. I prefer ssh because once I have added my public ssh key to GitHub that is the way I am identified and it is seemless.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The windows client uses http and you need to add your username and password.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So staying with the command line, this is how we clone:</span></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p><span>git clone </span><a href="mailto:git@github.com">&lt;span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"&gt;git@github.com&lt;/span&gt; </a><span>:njames/NextBigThing.git </span></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>h1. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Summary</span></p>
<pre>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So in this blog, we have learned that git is a great distributed source control system.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We have learned how to: 1. init 2. add 3. commit 4. push 5. clone</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There is a lot more to get into with git but you can get started and then learn as you go.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I hope you have found this a useful introduction and if this topic is of interest I will expand some of these topics.</span></p>
