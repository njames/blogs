# Sharing the OpenUI5 love

Last night in what was a very déjà vu momment for me I dropped in on a PHP User group meeting. My [very first blog on SDN](http://scn.sap.com/people/nigel.james/blog/2006/08/02/php-london-usergroup-meeting) was a promotion of a PHP User group event in London. 

Wow! That was over 8 years ago and since that very first stammering blog and some encouragement from [Craig Cmehil]() I have blogging ever since. Well, while I sip on some chateau de chasselas and reminisce, I do have some point.

Aside from the great talk on the new features in [PHP 5.6](http://php.net/manual/en/migration56.new-features.php) there was an opportunity for Lightning talks. So I grabbed some thoughts together and jumped up.

So what do you tell a bunch of web developers in the basement of a pub in Darling Harbour, Sydney about [#OpenUI5](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openui5) in 3 minutes.

Well, to be honest not a great deal, but I was able to acknoledge that SAP user interface is historically and generally recognised as sub-par but that SAP is committed to doing something abouut it. 

Of course I hung around afterwards and was able to chat to a couple of guys about different things they were doing which is the most fun part for me.

So if you have any opportunity to tell web developers the exciting things about what is going on with OpenUI5 then grab it.

Well, to be honest, not a great deal. I was able to acknowledge that SAP user interface is historically and generally recognised as sub-par but that SAP is committed to doing something about it and then show them a quick example of the new controls.
