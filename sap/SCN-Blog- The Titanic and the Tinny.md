# The Titanic and the Tinny

For some reason, and I am not exactly sure what prompted it, I started thinking recently about this idea of 'The Titanic and the Tinny'. Now most of you who live beyond the fair shores of paradise will be struggling no doubt to decipher this term 'Tinny' and be most puzzled about its true meaning.

It does, and no doubt about it, refer to a portion of amber liquid sold in a refreshingly cool aluminium can mostly seen in the wild being held wrapped by a neoprene cover to retain the cool and refreshing properties that were sought by the holder.

Nae, it is not to this tinny that I refer but one of a boating vessel of diminutive proportions. This tinny is also composed of aluminium something it shares with its namesake.

Thus the voyage we should undertake is a compare and contrast of seaworthy vessles and we shall discover that each posses properties fine and fare whilst at the sane time having attributes that can be fatal if not handled in the correct manner.
