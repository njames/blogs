# Decoding the developers commmunication skills



## 01. RPL - recognition of prior learning
	- who is developer?
	- who has strong comms / inter personal skills?
	- who has done a comms course / body lang / toast masters etc
    - who values communication as part of the software development process?    
## 01 - Know yourself  / get to know others 

## 01. team  together evveryone achieves more
	- work with others
	- talk to others
	- us v them / them = marketing / product owner / users

## 02. developers = kingmaker - steven monkchips
	- might be the case but a king needs to commmunicate - 'the kings speech'
	- present vision
	- become a bridge to product owners / stakeholders
	- sydney harbour bridge client in city - sap in sth syd 

## 02. Personality disc / myers briggs / PF16 - Language - golden rule
	- treat people as you would like to be treated
	- "Every communication is a cross-cultural communication"
	- we all have to realise how to work best together
	- beckham example - dont kick the ball how you kick the ball kick the ball so that your team mate can recieve it best to score.
	- in europe many languages - french / german / italian - people understand you when you speak in a language they understand
	- so you have to tailor what you are talking about to the audience 

	- tv examples - alias tech guy / lt cmd data / spock / bridge investigator / 

	- movie examples - 

	- class example
	
	Communicator () 

	function sendMessage(msg, type )

	function addListener(type)

	when listeners subscribe to the messages coming from the commmunicator they will only 'hear' the messages of the type that they are set to listen for.

	If we have 


	comms = new Communicator()

	comms->addListener( 'french' );
	commm->addListener( 'german');

	and we try to 

	comms->sendMessage( 'italian' );
	None of the listeners will get the message.


## 04. communication types - 
	 - visual / auditory / kinesthetic
	 - technical / non-technical
	 - back to personalities - 
	 - appreciation languages - time / gifts /  words / touch / service

 

## 05. Practicalities

	Speak so you can be heard - developers / introverts often speak in quiet tones
	Vary pitch 
	
	Posture - chin up / sholders back  (peanuts depressed stance)
    Confidence - comes from belief in yourself
    Fake it - pretend you are that confident person you know



## 06. leadership = influence

## 99. resources - books that have helped me
## 99. 21 values of leadership - maxwell
## 99. quiet
