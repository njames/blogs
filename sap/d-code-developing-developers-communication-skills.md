# Decoding the developers commmunication skills

## 01. RPL - recognition of prior learning
	- who is developer?
	- who has strong comms / inter personal skills?
	- who has done a comms course / body lang / toast masters etc
    - who values communication as part of the software development process?    
    - power of commuunication? name some powerful commmunicators ( ml king/regan/ hitler/churchill/ )

## 01. Getting out of the code cave
	- developers like quiet / focus 
	- many done see commmunication as necessary
	- to develop in your career it is essential to communicate well

## 01 - Know yourself  / get to know others 
	- if you dont know how you work - your strengths and weaknesses it will be harder to communicate effectively - get to know your blindspots and work around them
	- the most important person to lead is yourself (maxwell quote)
	- the most important person to communicate to is yourself
	- keep working out what makes you tick, what your passions are, what your buttons are, who presses those buttons and why

## 01. team  together everyone achieves more
	- it takes a team to create great software
	- no coder is an island
	- work with others
	- talk to others
	- listen to others
	- put aside prejustice (really pre judging - deciding you like or dont like someone or thing before you really get to know them)
	- develop relationships with those who think opposite to you 
	- that will challenge what you think and believe
	- us v them / them = marketing / product owner / users

## 02. developers = kingmaker - steven o'grady
	- might be the case but a king needs to commmunicate - 'the kings speech'
	- present vision
	- become a bridge to product owners / stakeholders
	- sydney harbour bridge client in city - sap in sth syd 
	- recognise the joy of jargon 
	- every speciality has a jargon 
	- communication is the transfer of an idea
	- the communicator is responsible for the message getting across
	- just because you have said your piece, doesnt mean that the audience has got it
	- leave room to check that the message has been recieved loud and clear
	- some cultures will say yes becuase they dont say no
	- this means that you have to work harder to ensure that the message has been received
	

## 02. Personality disc / myers briggs / PF16 - Language - golden rule
	- treat people as you would like to be treated
	- "Every communication is a cross-cultural communication"
	- we all have to realise how to work best together
	- beckham example - dont kick the ball how you kick the ball kick the ball so that your team mate can recieve it best to score.
	- in europe many languages - french / german / italian - people understand you when you speak in a language they understand
	- so you have to tailor what you are talking about to the audience 

	- tv examples - alias tech guy / lt cmd data / spock / bridge investigator / 

	- movie examples - 

	- class example
	
	Communicator () 

	function sendMessage(msg, type )

	function addListener(type)

	when listeners subscribe to the messages coming from the commmunicator they will only 'hear' the messages of the type that they are set to listen for.

	If we have 


	comms = new Communicator()

	comms->addListener( 'french' );
	commm->addListener( 'german');

	and we try to 

	comms->sendMessage( 'italian' );
	None of the listeners will get the message.


## 04. communication types - 
	 - visual / auditory / kinesthetic
	 - technical / non-technical
	 - back to personalities - 
	 - appreciation languages - time / gifts /  words / touch / service
 

## 05. Practicalities

	Speak so you can be heard - developers / introverts often speak in quiet tones
	Vary pitch 
	
	Posture - chin up / sholders back  (peanuts depressed stance)
    Confidence - comes from belief in yourself
    Fake it - pretend you are that confident person you know

    Grab every opportunity to practise
    You are communicating all the time

65% Non verbal
