<p>Last night in what was a very déjà vu momment for me I dropped in on a PHP User group meeting. My <a href="http://scn.sap.com/people/nigel.james/blog/2006/08/02/php-london-usergroup-meeting">very first blog on SDN</a> was a promotion of a PHP User group event in London.</p>
<p>Wow! That was over 8 years ago and since that very first stammering blog and some encouragement from <a href="http://scn.sap.com/people/craig.cmehil">Craig Cmehil</a> I have blogging ever since. Well, while I sip on some chateau de chasselas and reminisce, I do have some point.</p>
<p>Aside from the great talk on the new features in <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/migration56.new-features.php">PHP 5.6</a> there was an opportunity for Lightning talks. So I grabbed some thoughts together and jumped up.</p>
<p>So what do you tell a bunch of web developers in the basement of a pub in Darling Harbour, Sydney about <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openui5">#OpenUI5</a> in 3 minutes.</p>
<p>Well, to be honest not a great deal, but I was able to acknoledge that SAP user interface is historically and generally recognised as sub-par but that SAP is committed to doing something abouut it.</p>
<p>Of course I hung around afterwards and was able to chat to a couple of guys about different things they were doing which is the most fun part for me.</p>
<p>So if you have any opportunity to tell web developers the exciting things about what is going on with OpenUI5 then grab it.</p>
