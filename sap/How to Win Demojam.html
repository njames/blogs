<p>This year I was fortunate to to participate in the pre Las Vegas TechEd Innojam event.</p>
<p>I had been inspired by SAP Mentor Chris Rae whose partipation I had watched with a little mirth from 2014 when he was involved in DemoJam, and chose to also participate in Innojam. We all[1] thought he was nuts but Chris doesn't really do things by halves and we all had a laugh at his partner in crime Clint Voslo as he paraded before the world in a spingsuit as they used SAP Hana to find the best surf spot.</p>
<p>I was only entering Innojam I thought to myself as I convinced myself that coding for 32 hours was going to be a fun thing to do.</p>
<p>While I knew that all the Demojam entries would be picked from the Innojam, I didn't give it any thought that I would be a chance at being in the final six as I had no team and was heading over with no preparation.</p>
<p>The event started on Saturday night prior to TechEd. At 7pm there was a kick off event and speed dating for those who those who had not found a team. Being without a team did not last long for me as I very quickly ran into a team of four guys from Phoenix, AZ who were looking for a UI5 Developer. Team Patient Cues was born.</p>
<p>After the networking was over, the teams has been formed and our missions had been handed out we all headed off to get some sleep. This is a vital element. I had arrived from Australia earlier in the day and this was the end of my second Saturday for the week. One in the air flying to America and one on the ground getting ready. By the end of my second Saturday I was ready for some sleep.</p>
<p>Early the next morning after sleeping on our mission our team joined together to work thought some initial ideas for our solution. After kicking around some ideas we settled on improving the patient experience by providing feeback to customers on waiting times and thereby reducing percieved waiting times and also providing early information to the doctor to speed up appointments.</p>
<p>Thus our name &quot;Patient Cues&quot; was a play on cues given to the doctor and the shorter queues that the patient would have to endure.</p>
<p>Our team settled quickly into roles based on our experiences and this worked well. There were some inital teething problems with the environments that we had been allocated but the event team were very quickly onto this to make other arrangements.</p>
<p>We quickly sketched out our plans and screen sequences and I got started on the ui whilst the hana team got to work building the data and services to support the UI. We also had to submit documentation so other team members compiled this.</p>
<p>We were aware that time was quickly ticking on so we decided that 2 hour sprints were in order. We set up a makeshift count down of how much time we had left in two hour blocks and each part of our team had goals to hit for each 'sprint'. This also formed a very clear and visual reminder of how much time was remaining and helped keep us focused on the task at hand if tangents or issues arose.</p>
<p>This approach was working well and at about midnightish all parts of the puzzle were coming together and it was time to assemble them together. This is when we hit what became our biggest snag. The earlier issues with the platform meant that we were provided a hana one instance for our hana server.This was all working fine until we tried to bring everything together. Our Hana One instance was exposed over normal http while HCP was a https connection. If you are not familiar with this - this is what is known a mixed content. When I was trying to call the xsjs services over http the browser was having a pink fit about having to make an unsecure connection when a secure connection was requested.</p>
<p>This was turning into a bit of a showstopper.</p>
<p>As it was now after midnight and rapidly becoming 1 am in the morning the main support team was safely in bed and the graveyard shift of John Astil and Rui Ginera (sp) had arrived to keep the Innojammers on the straight an narrow. At first we thought we could fake it out and so we tried to use every chrome command line switch to relax the security. We then tried the same on firefox thinking that might be a little more forgiving. Nothing was working and I was rapidly losing ability to think straight. I needed to get some sleep. I found a couple of beanbag and fashioned a mattress and a couple more as a makeshift blanket. Four hours later at seven am, the rest of the team returned and the prime support crew turned up in part seeing my late night tweets asking for help. We got the https service running, found the right port and was able to install the certificate in the browser being used for the demo. Finally we had our end to end connection working but time was a-ticking and features were a-missing.</p>
<p>I needed to freshen up so with the situation handed over the rest of the team I went and did just that.</p>
<p>We managed to get more of our solution together as the hours ticked down but we arrived at the demo time feeling like we were way short of what we would have liked to get together but happy with our participation. We had come for the experience and getting any further was really not on our minds.</p>
<p>During the judging the teams were asked : &quot;How much longer would this take to get to present at demo jam?&quot; It was the first hint that we might be in the final.</p>
<p>At 2pm the moment had arrived and I was chatting with other participants about our chances as the winners were chosen.</p>
<p>Then it happened.</p>
<p>We were selected as a finalist.</p>
<p>This meant that we had to get ready to for Wednesday night.</p>
<p>First sleep.</p>
<p>As a team we came back together after the first keynote on Monday night and started our polish and our story for Demojom.</p>
<p>Several our team has presentations and other commitments that couldn't be broken and I had some meetings that I had no choice but to not attend.</p>
