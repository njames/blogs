# Facing the Abyss (5 - 7 minutes)

Inspirational talk.

I wonder if you have ever faced the Abyss? Have you ever come up close and personal with a deep dark fear that you thought that you would never overcome?

For a lot of us public speaking is such an Abyss. Whenever we even have the thought of public speaking our hearts race, our mind goes to jelly and we are unable to deliver the amazing talk that we spent so long rehearsing.

Today I want to talk about facing and overcoming our fears.

I like to think of fear as a gate to greatness, it is a bridge to brilliance, 

If you do not pass through the gate you cannot truely become great and we stay contained by the barrier that fear puts up in front of us.

It is said that the ship is not built for the harbour and yet out on the seas there are waves and storms and creatures that would like to do us in. 

Let me share with you a couple of moments when I have faced the Abyss of fear and lived to tell the tale. Firstly a physical abyss. I am  not great with heights and there have been several times that heights have nearly done me in but I think the most petrifying was the five freaky fingers.

Now the name sounds as scary as the actually location. In Austria a couple of hours from the capital Saltzburg there is this mountain high in the Alps that has sheer cliffs that drop vertically for about 2 kilometers.

To get there you need to take several ski lifts and at the top of the slope there is a 1 kilometer walk to get to the five freaky fingers. After having walked in the cold and through a path cut a meter deep into the snow way too close to the edge of the moutain, there are the fingers. Five ledges built straight out over the edge of the alps. Each with their own special way to terrify the vertigo out of you. One has a glass section you can literally see 2 kilometers straight down. One has ... The third ... thge fifth and lastly the fifth freaky finger is built ...

To be honest they freaked the living daylights out of me and while I tested a couple of them after a moment I was content to view from a safe distance.

And right here hiding in this fun  story about a high mountain and little vertigo is all we need to encounter and overcome our fears.

As I said at the beginning of this talk, public speaking is one of the things that people fear the most. In fact more people fear public speaking than death! This is an astonishing statistic but when you are standing in front of a crownd who are all peering intently on you with an expectation of the most incredible oration in the history of mankind perhaps disappearing into an abyss opening up under our feet is a preferable option.

Lets break it down...

Whether the fear is physical and literal fear like vertigo on a mountain or from standing in front of people the physical effects are similar. 

There is a benefit and a cost - on the mountain there is a spectacular view offset by the sensations of insecurity and falling. On the stage there is the fear of 'What if I have nothing to say?' or 'What if they don't like me?' These can be just as paralysing as the moutaintop experience. 

Let's think of the other side of the coin: What if you stayed in the valley? 
What if you don't take to the stage? The view will be missed as will the opportunity to share your unique and amazing story with an eager crowd of listeners.

Let me leave you with one final thought that comes from a conversation between a daughter and her mother. The daughter is about to undertake a new adventure and while this is exciting the fear still remains.
"Mother what if I fail? " she asks. To which her wise mother replies, "My darling what if you fly?"

Thank you.
