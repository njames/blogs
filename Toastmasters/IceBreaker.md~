## Point 1 - Family

This year I celebrated my 20 year wedding anniversary.  I have a good friend who grandmother has a saying - "The first 20 years are the worst!"

No one son is next who is a chess champion in the 11 yo age group in our area

And our youngest daugther at 9 is fast becoming the next big thing at London fashion week or a costume designer for Hollywood. 

## Point 2 - Community

Lastly community. My wife and I are very involved in our local church and enjoy entertaining
