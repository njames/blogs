Notoriety to Notable

Today i am going to Tell the story of someone you have seen ... perhaps many many times but someone who I doubt you know very much about.

A person who came from very humble and almost accidental beginnings to rise and become a powerful and connected mover and shaker

The story started in 1777 but it really began in 1791 when at 14 "James Burrow" was arrested for horse stealing.  He claimed that he was running an errand for a local farmer but the story didn't stick so he was sent to prison to await sentancing. The problem was his parents wer both dead and he was living with his grandmother who died a year earlier and she was bored with the domestic help roles that she had found herself in.

This was the start of his notoriety.

This notoriety was further compounded when during the trial his true identity was exposed as a girl and Molly (Mary) Haydock was promptly sentenced for 7 years transportation to Sydney town arriving in 1792.

But consider that in the six months between arrest and tranportation she managed to conseal her true identity and considering the types that she would have been in the slammer with that was probably self-preservation.

She started life in Sydney as a nursemaid in the household of Major Francis Grose and was pursued by Thomas Reibey a naval officer and merchant shipping operator whom she met on her transport.

Marrying Thomas at the age of 17 in 1794 they settled on the Hawkesbury River north of Sydney where they obtained property and commenced a merchant shipping operation due to naval and merchant contacts.

Thomas's business thrived over the years as he added more ships, increased his property holdings having established regular trade with India. It was during these long departures that Mary increased her business acumen having to manage the company in her husbands absence.

In 1811 disaster struck and Both Thomas and his business partner died within a month of each other in  leaving Mary in control of a sizable operation and seven children.

She was entirely capable of growing this operation even amoungst stiff competition from chinese indian and american traders. Even to the point of enforcing debt in the most direct way. There was at least one recorded assult of a debtor.

In 1820 after the operations continued to grow she sold her property and took two of her daughters to England perhaps with the intention of retiring. She aroused a great deal of interest from the area of her upbringing but she returned to Australia the following year having not quite finding the area as much to her liking.

Continuing to invest and prosper she built many properties in and around George St, Maquarie Place, Kings Wharf.

Gradually she retired from active business and lived off her investments.
She took an active interest in education, charity and the church. 

What we know today as the Westpac bank was founded in one of her properties which she leased to the bank and she held accounts and shares with the bank.

Her prominence and one of Australias first successful business women is now celebrated on the $20 note. Interestingly the image we see on the $20 is the only image that is recorded of her.

At least two novels have been loosely based on her life. In the 1980's a story called Sara Dane was brought to the TV screens in a mini-series treatment.

Why this story is of particular interest to me is that Mary Reibey is my 4-Greats Grandmother and whenever I crack a $50 I always try to spend less than $10 so that I can get two $20 notes.


And this my friends is how Mary Reibey went from Notoriety to Notable.
