WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

Sorry I am not sure if I made myself clear but I just don't get it.

I have been pretty absent from the old SDN space for a little while but I have been keeping tabs on you. Apparently someone thought it would be a great idea to take a well known event and just rename it to some sort of in joke.

Now I get that SAP TechEd was short for Technical Education and perhaps you think that d-code will appeal to the same crowd but beyond the name I feel that you have put the emphasis on the code and have removed the emphasis on the whole range of technical development roles. 

Surprisingly developing software is actually not all about algrithms, code cutting. beer and pizza. There are other activities that are as much about developing, creating, designing, crafting a software product other than just the code. 

Here is a suprise one...

Communication. Wow did I really say that out loud? A lot of devs struggle with this and don't the rest of their teams know it. Yes I am a developer and yes I have to continue to work on this area of my craft because it doesn't come naturaly. Personally I would like to hide in my code cave sometimes and leave the world to itself. Except it doenst work this way. There are other people to deal with and yes they think differently to you and yes you need to communicate with them. This also means its great to all congregate at a mass networking event like SAP Tech Ed. When I was last at TechEd, there was a range of people even though it was a Technical Education event. Yes, many were there to sell stuff and many were the other people around the 












So hopefully with all the changes that have been going around SAP recently we will soon find a way to get back to SAP TechEd (formerly SAP d-code (formerly SAP TechEd))
